# budgetapp

#### An app created in Streamlit for budget tracking within my family.

The app is coded in Python using a Streamlit frontend. 
The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database to store users and budget data. 

Each time the app is run it uses the user email to fetch existing budget entries for that user to display transactions and current budget balance. Each user can have multiple budgets and budgets can be shared between users.

This project was created as a proof of concept of Streamlit capabilities, as well as a display of my database design and application development skills.
